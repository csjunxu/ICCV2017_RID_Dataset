His numerical tour of image processing is a great resource. Some of our Matlab routine is directly derived from his Matlab script

2. Alessandro Foi: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/
We use LASIP toolbox for noise variance estimation, and noise model calibration.
Our framework also greatly depends on his BM3D script.
